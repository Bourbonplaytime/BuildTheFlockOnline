        <h4 class="headings-bottom">An Online Network of University of Louisville Athletics Fans and Supporters</h4>
      </div>

      <p class="intro-text">This project is still in a pretty young state as compared to what I have in my head and I expect a lot of big additions. With that in mind I wanted to take a space and dedicate it to keeping people up to date with what's going on with #BTF as the group grows and this project progresses. I never dreamed years ago when I started shouting people out and #BTF started to gain traction that I'd be sitting here today building a website. Yet here we are. If you're seeing this I guess I'm live so that's a big step forward.</p>

      <p class="intro-text">I decided I wanted to create buildtheflock.com to expand and grow #btf and I intend to create an environment where people can create an account and link FB, Insta, Snap, Websites, Soundclouds, Podcasts, or whatever you want. I've made a lot of personal friends over my years on 'Ville Twitter' and it's been an uplifting supplement to my life. I am a believer in getting to know people. I can't count the times I stepped away from what I was doing irl and read some joke some knucklehead on the internet wrote and life felt better.</p>

      <p class="intro-text">I want this to be a place where Louisville fans can share their passion, pride, and compassion. I look at my hand written notes where I've collected hundreds of twitter handles over a series of years and wonder what I'm doing? Then I think about the people I've met and what they've meant to me and it all seems worth it. So let's get together at tailgates and bars as we celebrate what brought us all together. Let's use the internet as a tool to let the country and the world know U of L and it's fanbase are as passionate as any in the country. Go Cards and let's get to building the flock.</p>
