        <p class="intro-text">I know it has been awaited by a lot of frustrated Cardinals fans for the majority of this season for AD Vince Tyra to address HC Bobby Petrino's job status. I would be highly surprised for this to be addressed before the season is over with. I don't expect Bobby to be retained. Tyra has announced a press conference post season on 12/19 to address the state of the football program. The timer below is counting down to that press conference as I imagine if Bobby is to be bought out that it would be announced at said press conference. So if you are one of what feels like the majority of Cards fans who are awaiting that announcement I built the below timer for you to track how long you might have to wait.</p>

          <p class="intro-text">Greetings Cards fans! It's long overdue that I updated this section of the website. Since launch shortly before our kickoff game vs Alabama I have been periodically adding on to the site as I've had time. We have seen the launch of a forum, monthly add pages, and cool features and styling. I should be seeing a lot more free time between 11/16 and the new year and I'd like to address account functionality over that time frame. I had mentioned I would like to create an environment where people could create an account to link other social media or any other online infrastructure you may want to represent yourself or promote your own personal ventures. So that is the goal between now and 2019. I hope everyone is as excited for basketball season as I am and as always Build The Flock #BTF.</p>

          <p class="intro-text">I want this to be a place where Louisville fans can share their passion, pride, and compassion. I look at my hand written notes where I've collected hundreds of twitter handles over a series of years and wonder what I'm doing? Then I think about the people I've met and what they've meant to me and it all seems worth it. So let's get together at tailgates and bars as we celebrate what brought us all together. Let's use the internet as a tool to let the country and the world know U of L and it's fanbase are as passionate as any in the country. Go Cards and let's get to building the flock.</p>
