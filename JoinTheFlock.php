      <p>If you are interested in getting your twitter acct promoted by #BTF you are in luck. I just need your twitter handle and all it takes is being a U of L fan on the internet (there are steps that I take to try and ensure people will participate, so don't expect that you will get very far if you're not into following the flock as they follow you.) Feel free to shoot me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:buildtheflock502@gmail.com"> buildtheflock502@gmail.com</a> or hit me up on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/BuildTheFlockUL" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="true">@BuildTheFlockUL.</a> I am currently working on incorporating Instagram on #BTF so stay tuned for updates as this progresses. My attitude is the bigger the better with #BTF and though it is a commitment of time and effort I am happy to bring any U of L fan into contact with our network. Don't be shy and feel welcome to bring your friends. This is a great way to break on to twitter which can be a hard thing to do when you are new to the platform. So I highly welcome U of L fans who are interested in twitter but don't know where to get started. If you haven't already jump on board and let's get to building the flock. </p>
