BuildTheFlockOnline

Build the flock online is designed to be a network to bring U of L athletics fans together on twitter. This has been a project of mine for several years and I've always wanted a web hub to be a central point for the project. As far as I know nothing outside of what is global to browsers and the plugin within the code are needed to view this project.

There are quite a few custom pieces of CSS in this project that manipulate color, style, layout, etc.

There are 2 main pieces of Javascript on the main page (buildtheflockonline.html.) The first of which manipulates several different images in a 30 second loop. The 2nd of which inserts html upon a button click.
