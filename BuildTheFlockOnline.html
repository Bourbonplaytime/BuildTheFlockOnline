         <p class="intro-text">Build the Flock (#btf) is a portal to expand and improve the online network of University of Louisville fans and supporters. #btf was inspired by Mike Rutherford aka <a class="twitter-follow-button" href="https://twitter.com/CardChronicle" target="_blank">@CardChronicle</a><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> stating on the now defunct 93.9 fm version of the Ramsey and Rutherford radio show that the Louisville fanbase has now expanded to the point where anyone could get on twitter and have 1000 followers almost overnight.</p>

         <p class="intro-text">I took this as a challenge and set off to try and help build online infrastructure that would be able to help Louisville fans find each other and expand their networks online. This venture began as a simple series of twitter shoutouts and is looking to take a big step up with this website which I intend to not only provide an easy way to find and add other Cards fans on twitter but also allow to reference any other social media accounts one may have.</p>

       <p class="intro-text">Welcome to a hub that I have created with the intention of growing and strengthening "Ville twitters" online presence. It has been a personal blessing for me to have stumbled upon this online collective and I can't count the times that 'people from the internet' I met originally tweeting about U of L have made their way into my life as personal friends and brought with them perspective, passion, entertainment, and an uplifting. The nature of this venture is in respects to people who helped me break into this culture when your humble narrator was still a 'struggle tweeter' trying to figure Ville twitter out.</p>
