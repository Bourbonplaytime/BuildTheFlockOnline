        <p class="intro-text">Build the Flock (#BTF) is a portal to expand and improve the online network of University of Louisville fans and supporters. #BTF was inspired by Mike Rutherford aka <a class="twitter-follow-button" href="https://twitter.com/CardChronicle" target="_blank">@CardChronicle</a><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> stating on the now defunct 93.9 fm version of the Ramsey and Rutherford radio show that the Louisville fanbase has now expanded to the point where anyone could get on twitter and have 1000 followers almost overnight.</p>

      <p class="intro-text">Welcome to a hub that I have created with the intention of growing and strengthening "Ville twitters" online presence. It has been a personal blessing for me to have stumbled upon this U of L corner of twitter, and the relationships I have built both online and in the flesh have been incredibly invaluable. I can't say thank you enough to those who helped me break on to Ville twitter, and it's in respects to you that I am capable to present this project.</p>
