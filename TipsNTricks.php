          <p class="intro-text">Go to add pages for links to Louisville fans twitter accounts, I have also added a twitter list from which people can add (<a href=https://twitter.com/BuildTheFlockUL/lists/btf target="_blank">#BTF Twitter List</a>.) All you have to do is click and follow up. There are hundreds right now and growing. I'm on a mission to get to 1000 at the very minimum, and there's no reason for this not to grow indefinitely.</p>
          <p class="intro-text">Twitter will suspend your acct for 'bot behavior' if you add too many people in a day. I'd suggest keeping it under 100 adds or 1 page per day from #btf (Pages contain 96 adds.) The monthly hatchling pages do not have a predefined amount of adds, that is determined by how many people are added in a month. As of now none of them are big enough that they should cause problems with twitter.</p>
          <p class="intro-text">If you are new to #btf I suggest that you add the whole list. This is time consuming but at that point you are done and new people should add you as they are introduced. All you have to do is follow them back and you can continue to grow as this community does. You will have to space this out as twitter suspends accts who add too many people in one day.</p>
          <p class="intro-text"> #BTF is designed to make the process of growing your network of U of L fans on twitter easier but it is still a process and it does take some time and effort. Have fun, do things at your own pace, and be kind to people. I'm obviously very into the idea of growing our network but the idea of social media is to have fun so don't get frustrated.
